# Arisu's Card Game

A fun Linux command-line game where players help Arisu collect the five pieces of Exodia by using various Linux commands and techniques.

## Game Mechanics

Players progress through different stages, each teaching different Linux concepts:

1. Basic file operations (`ls`, `cat`)

5. File creation and exact string matching
